## Proposal: Unveiling Research Trends with arXiv Data Visualization

**High-Level Goal:** To leverage data visualization techniques to explore emerging research trends within the vast collection of arXiv open access preprints.

**Goals and Motivation:** 

The ever-growing volume of scientific research published on arXiv presents a challenge in staying abreast of current trends and identifying groundbreaking advancements. Our project aims to address this challenge by creating a suite of data visualizations that unveil hidden patterns and trends within arXiv preprints. By analyzing titles, abstracts, and potentially other metadata (depending on data availability), we can provide researchers with valuable insights into:

- **Emerging research areas:** Identifying rapidly growing topics and potential breakthroughs across different scientific disciplines.
- **Collaboration patterns:** Visualizing co-authorship networks to understand research communities and collaborations driving innovation.
- **Author productivity:** Highlighting highly productive researchers and their areas of focus.
- **Shifting trends:** Tracking changes in research focus over time and identifying potential paradigm shifts within specific fields.

This project presents a novel approach to navigating the vast ocean of arXiv preprints. By leveraging data visualization, we can bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights, empowering researchers to make informed decisions about their own research directions and collaborations.

**Research Question:**

How can data visualization techniques be used to uncover and communicate emerging trends within the arXiv open access preprints collection?

**Data Collection and Approach:**

We plan to utilize existing tools and libraries to crawl data from arXiv preprints. This data will likely include titles, abstracts, publication dates, author affiliations, and potentially other relevant metadata fields depending on availability. We will then employ data cleaning and transformation techniques to prepare the data for visualization.
