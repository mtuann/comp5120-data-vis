# Project:  Unveiling Research Trends with arXiv Data Visualization 

**Data:** 

[`data`](https://github.com/mtuann/comp5120-data-vis/blob/main/project02/arxiv05_v2.csv)
*High-Level Goal:** To leverage data visualization techniques to explore emerging research trends within the vast collection of arXiv open access preprints.

**Goals and Motivation:** 

The ever-growing volume of scientific research published on arXiv presents a challenge in staying abreast of current trends and identifying groundbreaking advancements. Our project aims to address this challenge by creating a suite of data visualizations that unveil hidden patterns and trends within arXiv preprints. By analyzing titles, abstracts, and potentially other metadata (depending on data availability), we can provide researchers with valuable insights into:

- **Emerging research areas:** Identifying rapidly growing topics and potential breakthroughs across different scientific disciplines.
- **Shifting trends:** Tracking changes in research focus over time and identifying potential paradigm shifts within specific fields.
<!-- - **Collaboration patterns:** Visualizing co-authorship networks to understand research communities and collaborations driving innovation.
- **Author productivity:** Highlighting highly productive researchers and their areas of focus. -->

This project presents a novel approach to navigating the vast ocean of arXiv preprints. By leveraging data visualization, we can bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights, empowering researchers to make informed decisions about their own research directions and collaborations.

**Research Question:**

How can data visualization techniques be used to uncover and communicate emerging trends within the arXiv open access preprints collection?

**Data Collection and Approach:**

We utilize existing tools and libraries to crawl data from arXiv preprints. This data include titles, abstracts, publication dates, author affiliations, and potentially other relevant metadata fields depending on availability. Our data are collected from 2023-11-03 to 2024-05-03 with 50.000 Computer Science (2000 pages * 25 papers/ page) papers in 8 subjects:

  - Economics
  - Electrical Engineering and Systems Science
  - Computer Science
  - Mathematics
  - Physics
  - Quantitative Biology
  - Quantitative Finance
  - Statistics

## Question 1: How has the number of preprints in different research areas related to Computer Science changed over time?

## Question 2: What are the most common keywords in the titles and abstracts of preprints in the field of Computer Science?

# Conclusion:
In this study, we have developed a suite of data visualizations to uncover hidden patterns and trends within arXiv preprints, focusing specifically on the field of Computer Science. By analyzing the titles, abstracts, and metadata of a comprehensive dataset of arXiv submissions, we have successfully provided valuable insights into the dynamic landscape of scientific research.

Our analysis highlights several key findings:.
- **Rapidly Growing Number of papers:** Rapidly growing number of paper Computer Science.
- **Trends:** analysis revealed a set of common terms frequently appearing in the titles and abstracts of Computer Science preprints. 

The visualizations and insights presented in this paper provide researchers, policymakers, and funding agencies with a clearer understanding of the evolving landscape of Computer Science research. By identifying rapidly growing topics and tracking changes in research focus, stakeholders can make informed decisions regarding research directions. Our work demonstrates the power of data-driven approaches in analyzing large-scale scientific data. The methodologies and findings of this study can be extended to other disciplines and datasets, offering a scalable solution for monitoring and understanding the progress of scientific research in the modern era. Future work could include expanding the dataset, incorporating more sophisticated natural language processing techniques, and developing predictive models to forecast future research trends.
