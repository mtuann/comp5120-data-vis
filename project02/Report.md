# Project:  Unveiling Research Trends with arXiv Data Visualization 

**Data:** [`data`](https://github.com/mtuann/comp5120-data-vis/blob/main/project02/arxiv05_v2.csv)
*High-Level Goal:** To leverage data visualization techniques to explore emerging research trends within the vast collection of arXiv open access preprints.

**Goals and Motivation:** 

The ever-growing volume of scientific research published on arXiv presents a challenge in staying abreast of current trends and identifying groundbreaking advancements. Our project aims to address this challenge by creating a suite of data visualizations that unveil hidden patterns and trends within arXiv preprints. By analyzing titles, abstracts, and potentially other metadata (depending on data availability), we can provide researchers with valuable insights into:

- **Emerging research areas:** Identifying rapidly growing topics and potential breakthroughs across different scientific disciplines.
- **Shifting trends:** Tracking changes in research focus over time and identifying potential paradigm shifts within specific fields.
<!-- - **Collaboration patterns:** Visualizing co-authorship networks to understand research communities and collaborations driving innovation.
- **Author productivity:** Highlighting highly productive researchers and their areas of focus. -->

This project presents a novel approach to navigating the vast ocean of arXiv preprints. By leveraging data visualization, we can bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights, empowering researchers to make informed decisions about their own research directions and collaborations.

**Research Question:**

How can data visualization techniques be used to uncover and communicate emerging trends within the arXiv open access preprints collection?

**Data Collection and Approach:**

We utilize existing tools and libraries to crawl data from arXiv preprints. This data include titles, abstracts, publication dates, author affiliations, and potentially other relevant metadata fields depending on availability. Our data are collected from 2023-11-03 to 2024-05-03 with 50.000 Computer Science (2000 pages * 25 papers/ page) papers in 8 subjects:

  - Economics
  - Electrical Engineering and Systems Science
  - Computer Science
  - Mathematics
  - Physics
  - Quantitative Biology
  - Quantitative Finance
  - Statistics

# Conclusion:

The analysis conducted reveals insightful trends in Valentine's Day celebrations and spending patterns over the years. Despite a general decline in the number of people participating in Valentine's Day festivities, a surge was observed in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by a continuation of the downward trend post-pandemic. Conversely, expenditure on Valentine's Day activities exhibited a consistent upward trajectory between 2010 and 2022, with consumers anticipating an increase in spending per person, notably in categories such as Jewelry and Evening Dates. During the pandemic, while gift card purchases surged, other categories experienced a decline, particularly in dining out, which approached levels similar to clothing expenditure. Notably, jewelry emerged as the costliest gift category, more than doubling in average expenditure per person. Overall, the analysis indicates shifting trends in both participation and spending habits, influenced by external factors such as the pandemic.
